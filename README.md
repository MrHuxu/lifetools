I just want to state the frameworks and softwares that I have used to write this web-app.  

- Sinatra

- semantic-ui

- jQuery

- watir-webdriver

- PhantomJS

Unfortunatly, I don't know how to deploy PhantomJS on Heroku, so, one feture of this app doesn't work, but the other one works very well.  

And if you know how to deploy Sinatra and PhantomJS together on Heroku, could you please teach me?
